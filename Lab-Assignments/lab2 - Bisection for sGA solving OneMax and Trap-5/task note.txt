Task: Minimally required population size (MRPS)


Code: 
- sGA + POPOP (tournament_size = 4, pc = 100%, pm = 0%)
	+ onemax
	+ trap-5

- How to find MRPS with bisection:
	+ process 1: Find upper bound
	+ process 2: Find MRPS

	* success: pass 10 test (with different Random Seed)
	* same 10 random seed for two process

- Run 10 times bisection (mssv+0/10/...90) to get statistical data
